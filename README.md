# FAC week 9: Building Amazon

Monday: Kick off with [Jame's](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/begin_react_workshop) workshop on React.

Tuesday is README day, with a twist. We are going to ask students to produce short video tutorials on some element of React. One of:
  - JSX
  - State and props
  - Component lifecycle
  - Animations
  - Get up and running in React
  - Tutorial in the React Docs
  - ...

The project for the week will be to build Amazon. This is a fairly open ended and potentially endless challenge but, to help, we are going to break it down into a few features that we definitely want to see and a few that can be added as stretch goals.

- A user should be able to register an account
- A user should be able to login
- A user should be able to logout
- A user should see an item that is available to buy
- A user should be able to buy an item

Stretch goals!

- A user should be able to leave a review on an item
- A user should be able submit an item to the store
